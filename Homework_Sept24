  I found the exercises really helpful, simplifying the language to see how each style/flow is applied. 
The div > p helped me to understand how to color separate parts within a div. I now have a much better 
understanding for the website of how to space out the paragraphs and pictures from the margins, which I 
had still been a bit confused on before. In the positioning exercise part 1, I am still a bit confused 
about when to use a relative/absolute/fixed position. An aha-moment happened with the CSS overflow exercises.
I thought it was going to be much more complicated when it came to the scrollbar, and this will definitely
help with the idea I have for the website.
